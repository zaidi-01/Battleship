# Battleship Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Battleship game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Game Rules

The game is played on a grid board. Each player has a fleet of ships that they place on their own board. Players take turns guessing the coordinates of their opponent's ships. If a guess hits a ship, it is marked as a hit. If a guess misses, it is marked as a miss. The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins the game.
